OpenJDKBuildTest
================

The repo for the OpenJDK Build & Test working group notes, minutes, discussions 

This is a live document. We are still in the very early stages of this and want your participation.

The purpose of this project is to provide technical capabilities for build & test of OpenJDK, not to determine how they are or should be used. Whilst we provide some sample use cases, the project is intended to be used by others, possibly in entirely unforseen ways. Unix kernel hackers sometimes refer to this as the distinction between mechanism & policy.

To quote from Linux Device Drives (O'Reilly & Associates) 

"The distinction between mechanism and policy is one of the best ideas behind the Unix design. Most programming problems can indeed be split into two parts: "what capabilities are to be provided" (the mechanism) and "how those capabilities can be used" (the policy). If the two issues are addressed by different parts of the program, or even by different programs altogether, the software package is much easier to develop and to adapt to particular needs."

In case it isn't already apparent, we are interested only in mechanism - policy is someone else's job.

If this is interesting to you, great, we'd love your support.
